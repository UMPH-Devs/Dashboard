# Dashboard
The UMPH Dashboard is a **Continuous Monitor** framework for visualizing regularly scheduled tasks. It consists of a web service with a Rest API. Applications must include a call to the Dashboard in order to report their status. What is reported is dependent on the application and may be as complex or as simple as required. The Dashboard was designed as a screen that can be kept up in a common central location or on individual desktop or remote displays. At a glance it is made obvious if any tasks have not run or have thrown an error or warning during their current or last run.

**Continuous Monitoring** refers to the process and technology required to incorporate monitoring across each phase of your DevOps and IT operations lifecycles. It helps to continuously ensure the health, performance, and reliability of your application and infrastructure as it moves from development to production. Continuous monitoring builds on the concepts of *Continuous Integration* and *Continuous Deployment* (CI/CD) which help you develop and deliver software faster and more reliably to provide continuous value to your users.
   
In order to gain observability across your entire environment, you need to enable monitoring on all your applications and services. This will allow you to easily visualize end-to-end transactions and connections across all the components.

A critical aspect of monitoring is proactively notifying administrators of any current and predicted issues. The **UMPH Dashboard** is one way to keep the team informed of any critical errors, warnings, or network issues.
